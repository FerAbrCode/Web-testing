          This page explains how to think about breaking news in prediction
          markets (like Polymarket) and how to turn a headline into a clear,
          testable market question.
        </p>

        <section class="callout" aria-labelledby="about-implications">
          <h3 id="about-implications">Implications for Polymarket (general)</h3>
          <p>
            Breaking news typically moves markets because it changes the
            probability of an outcome, not because it is “good” or “bad.” The
            strongest price moves usually happen when news is both
            <strong>credible</strong> (verifiable) and <strong>surprising</strong>
            (meaningfully different from what traders expected).
          </p>
          <p>
            Example (Jan 13, 2026): Ukraine’s parliament dismissed Vasyl Malyuk
            from the post of Head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). A
            story like this can shift expectations about near-term announcements,
            institutional continuity, and what is likely to be confirmed (and
            when) by official channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good reasoning process:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Start with the resolution rule: what exactly must happen for the
              market to resolve “Yes”?
            </li>
            <li>
              Identify the causal chain: which facts in the story actually make
              “Yes” more likely (and which are just commentary)?
            </li>
            <li>
              Separate signal from noise: prefer official documents and
              timestamped announcements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Track base rates and alternatives: ask “what usually happens in
              similar situations?” and “what else could still happen?”
            </li>
            <li>
              Re-check incentives and timing: upcoming events can add volatility
              even if the long-run probability is unchanged.
            </li>
          </ul>
