            Headline: <strong>Ukrainian Parliament dismisses Vasyl Malyuk as Head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU)</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Summary: On January 13, 2026, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine’s
            parliament) dismissed Vasyl Malyuk from the post of Head of the
            Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). This is notable because leadership
            changes in major security institutions can affect decision-making,
            continuity of operations, and the timing/credibility of future
            official announcements.

            <strong>Implications for Polymarket</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Market framing: for political/institutional stories, define the
              exact “Yes” condition (e.g., an official appointment vote, decree,
              or government announcement).
            </li>
            <li>
              Timing risk: leadership changes can create gaps between a headline
              and a formal replacement, creating volatility around deadlines.
            </li>
            <li>
              Information flow: prioritize primary documents and official
              statements; treat unverified posts as low-confidence signals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Liquidity/spread: expect wider spreads during uncertainty and
              tighter spreads after confirmations.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="list">
            <li>Will Ukraine appoint a new SBU head by February 1, 2026?</li>
            <li>Will Ukraine confirm an acting SBU head within 7 days of Jan 13, 2026?</li>
            <li>Will a named candidate be officially appointed as SBU head by March 1, 2026?</li>
            <li>Will an official government statement cite a reason for the dismissal within 14 days?</li>
